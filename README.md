### Brief

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** meaning multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes**
* **Have a visually impressive design**
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end.

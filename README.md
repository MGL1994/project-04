### Brief

* Render a **grid-based game** in the browser
* Allow **player** to **move left or right & fire a laser**.
* **Automatically move enemies right, left & down, as well as periodically dropping bombs.**
* The player should be able to **clear at least one wave of enemies, upon which the game starts again**.
* The player's **score should be displayed at the end of the game**.
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files.**
* **Use Javascript for DOM manipulation.**
* **Deploy your game online, using Github Pages**, where the rest of the world can access it.
* **Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS** (adhere to best practices).
